# Reto-que-leemos-los-mexicanos
This project analyzes reading habits in Mexico using real survey data and statistical methods implemented in R.  The main objective is to explore relationships between reading behavior, demographic variables and reading preferences, and to identify statistically significant differences between groups.
## What is done in this project

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Correlation analysis between quantitative variables.
- Comparison of groups using statistical hypothesis testing.
- Interpretation of results in the context of reading behavior in Mexico.

## Statistical methods used

- Correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman, depending on variable type and distribution).
- One-way ANOVA to evaluate statistically significant differences between multiple groups.
- Assumption checking for ANOVA:
  - normality of residuals
  - homogeneity of variances
- Post-hoc analysis to identify which groups differ when the ANOVA result is significant.

## Project structure

The analysis is organized into different stages:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Correlation analysis
- ANOVA analysis by group and by year
- Final report generation

Each stage is documented and reproducible using R Markdown files.

## Main goal

To demonstrate practical use of statistical inference techniques (correlation and ANOVA) applied to a real social dataset, with clear interpretation of results and reproducible analysis workflows.
